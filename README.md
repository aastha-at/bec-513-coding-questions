# Question 1
The list of patterns that need to be pulled are stored in a set for easy lookups. I read the q1_data.tsv.gz as standard input and if the current line has any pattern present in the set, the line is printed to the output.
```
zcat  ../data/q1_data.tsv.gz | python code1.py > ../output/lines.tsv
```
